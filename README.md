## UI/UX Design üé®
The UI/UX design of the POS System is inspired by the modern design of Windows 11. The application is built using WinUI, which is a native user interface (UI) framework for Windows Desktop applications. The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

### Highlights:
- Modern design inspired by Windows 11
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Easy navigation and accessibility
- Consistent design across all screens

### Theme Switching:
- Implemented a theme switching feature allowing users to toggle between light and dark modes.
- The light theme provides a bright and clean interface, ideal for well-lit environments.
- The dark theme offers a darker interface, reducing eye strain in low-light conditions.
- Users can switch themes from the settings menu, and the selected theme is saved for future sessions.

#### Light Theme:

## Design Patterns / Architecture üß©
This project applies widely adopted software design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

#### Design Patterns:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data.
- Repository Pattern: Abstraction of data access logic from the rest of the application.

#### Architecture:
- The application is structured using the MVVM design pattern, with separate folders for Models, Views, and ViewModels.
- Repositories and services are defined using interfaces to promote consistency and facilitate unit testing.

## Key Features üóùÔ∏è

### Milestone 1

#### User Management:
- Users can register and log in to the application using email and password.
- Password strength, email validation, and remember me features are implemented.

#### CRUD Operations:
- Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, categories, and brands.
- Products, categories, and brands are displayed in a list format with details information. 
- Products can be added with details such as name, price, stock, category, and brand.

#### Search, Filter, and Sort:
- Users can search for products by name using the search bar.
- Products can be filtered by category or by max price to narrow down the search results.
- Products can be sorted by price in ascending or descending order.

### Milestone 2

- Employees can be added to the system by logging in with Google or creating an account.
- Employees can be updated and deleted from the system as needed.

#### Interface Segregation:
- Interfaces are used to define contracts for services and repositories to promote testability.
- Services and repositories implement these interfaces to provide concrete implementations.

#### Unit Testing:
- ViewModel and Converter classes are tested using the MSTest framework to ensure correctness.
- Mock objects are used to simulate data access and external dependencies for testing.

### Milestone 3

#### Create Invoice
- Allow users to create an invoice by selecting products and quantities from the list.
- Users can view the total price of the invoice and name of the employee who created it

#### Edit Invoice
- Users can edit the invoice by adding or removing products and updating the quantities.
- The total price is updated dynamically based on the changes made to the invoice.
