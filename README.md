## UI/UX Design üé®
The UI/UX design of the POS System is inspired by the modern design of Windows 11. The application is built using WinUI, which is a native user interface (UI) framework for Windows Desktop applications. The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

### Highlights:
- Modern design inspired by Windows 11
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Easy navigation and accessibility
- Consistent design across all screens

### Theme Switching:
- Implemented a theme switching feature allowing users to toggle between light and dark modes.
- The light theme provides a bright and clean interface, ideal for well-lit environments.
- The dark theme offers a darker interface, reducing eye strain in low-light conditions.
- Users can switch themes from the settings menu, and the selected theme is saved for future sessions.

## Design Patterns / Architecture üß©
This project applies widely adopted software design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

#### Design Patterns:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data.
- Repository Pattern: Abstraction of data access logic from the rest of the application.

#### Architecture:
- The application is structured using the MVVM design pattern, with separate folders for Models, Views, and ViewModels.
- Repositories and services are defined using interfaces to promote consistency and facilitate unit testing.

## Key Features üóùÔ∏è

### Milestone 1

#### User Management:
- Users can register and log in to the application using email and password.
- Password strength, email validation, and remember me features are implemented.

#### CRUD Operations:
- Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, categories, and brands.
- Products, categories, and brands are displayed in a list format with details information. 
- Products can be added with details such as name, price, stock, category, and brand.

#### Search, Filter, and Sort:
- Users can search for products by name using the search bar.
- Products can be filtered by category or by max price to narrow down the search results.
- Products can be sorted by price in ascending or descending order.

### Milestone 2

#### CRUD Employees:
- Users can view a list of employees and their details, including name and email.
- Employees can be added to the system by logging in with Google or creating an account.
- Employees can be updated and deleted from the system as needed.

#### Interface Segregation:
- Interfaces are used to define contracts for services and repositories to promote testability.
- Services and repositories implement these interfaces to provide concrete implementations.

#### Unit Testing:
- ViewModel and Converter classes are tested using the MSTest framework to ensure correctness.
- Mock objects are used to simulate data access and external dependencies for testing.

## Advanced Topics üöÄ

### Milestone 1

#### Google Authentication:
- Users can log in to the application using their Google account with OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure access.
- User information is saved to the database upon successful authentication, ensuring a personalized experience.

#### Stripe Integration:
- The application supports online VISA payments using the Stripe payment gateway.
- Users can enter their card details and complete the payment process securely and efficiently.

### Milestone 2

#### Complete Google & Stripe Integration:
- Google authentication and Stripe integration are fully implemented and tested to ensure a seamless user experience.

#### Database Migration and Seeding:
- The application supports database migration to update the schema with new changes.
- A seeding script is provided to populate the database with initial data for testing.

#### Theme Switching:
- Users can switch between light and dark themes to customize the application's appearance.
- The selected theme is saved in the user's settings and persists across sessions.

## Teamwork / Git Flow ü§ù
The project follows a collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub to manage code changes and contributions.

#### Teamwork:
- The team collaborates on feature development, bug fixes, and code reviews.
- Each team member is assigned tasks and works collaboratively to achieve project milestones.
- Regular meetings are held to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.

#### Git Flow:
- Regular commit messages follow a consistent format and provide context for changes.
- Feature branches are created for new features and merged into the main branch after code review.
- Issues are tracked on GitHub to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.

- Test cases are created to validate user interactions, data input, and edge cases.

#### Automated Testing (Unit Tests):
- Unit tests are written using the MSTest framework to test individual components.
- Using the Moq library, mock objects are created to simulate data access and external dependencies.
- ViewModel tests are written to verify business logic and data manipulation.
- Converter tests are written to validate data conversion and formatting.

#### Total: 89 Tests
